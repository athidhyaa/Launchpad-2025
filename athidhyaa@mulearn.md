About Me
Hi, I’m ATHIDHYA A, a B.Tech student in COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING at ACE College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
I’m passionate about Coding and how it’s reshaping the world. I enjoy blending tech with real life — whether it’s vibe coding or exploring how coding  can be part of everyday experiences.
I’m a fast learner, always curious, and constantly looking for ways to level up my skills — especially in Coding, app development, and web development .
